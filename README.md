# SELF TALK
This will be an educational game designed to aid students in understanding SEL (social-emotional learning).

This project will help students master SEL through a fun and interactive medium. The central idea behind the project is Read, Retain, Recite. Students should read about a topic, commit it to memory, and demonstrate mastery of the topic. The game will help them retain the information or grasp the meaning of the lesson through a fun activity.
